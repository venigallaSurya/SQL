--Create table with auto increment 
create table employee
( id int autoincrement,
  name varchar(49)
  primary key(id)
);
When auto increment is present we need to make sure that it is added in primary key
  
--insert records 
insert into tablename(column_name) values('values which are required')
  
-- multi updates
update employee set age=20, salary=20000 where hiring_date='2020-01-21'

--Limit 
Select * from table limit 2;

-- Sorting the data 
Select * from table order by column name

---  table and data for group by 
 
 create table order_date
 (
    cust_id int,
    order_id int,
    country varchar(50),
    state varchar(50)
 );
 
 Insert into order_date values(1,20,'USA','Seatle');
 Insert into order_date values(2,30,'USA','Seatle');
 Insert into order_date values(3,40,'USA','WDC');
 Insert into order_date values(4,60,'India','AP');
 Insert into order_date values(5,90,'India','Sikkim');
 Insert into order_date values(6,121,'UK','London');
 
 select count(cust_id), state from order_date group by country
 
 Apart from the columns which are not the part of group by statement they need to be a part of agregate functions
 
 -- Use of having clause
 having is followed after groupby
 select country from orderdate group by country having count(*)=1;
 
So for the above case we observe that only group by column is mentioned in the select statement as a result we don't use aggregate function
 
 where and group by which sequence should be followed?
  first where clause followed by group by clause
